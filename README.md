# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
### This website is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Bootstrap is used for UI. 
### This helps in visualizing the 5 most common sorting algorithms, ie Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.  
### User can select the number of elements. 4 available options are 20, 50, 100 or 200 elements
### The length of each columns represent the value of each element. These lengths are generated randomly. At the end, all columns will be sorted in increasing order.
### Press the Play button to start sorting visualisation, Pause button to pause at that frame, and Start New button to start with new set of randomized columns.
